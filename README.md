# Transformer-Based Language Model

This repository contains Python code for training and using a transformer-based language model. The model is implemented using PyTorch and is capable of generating text based on a given starting prompt. It leverages the Transformer architecture, which has shown remarkable performance in natural language processing tasks.

## Features

- **Transformer Architecture**: Utilizes the Transformer architecture for modeling sequences, enabling efficient training and generation of text.
- **Text Generation**: Generates text based on a given starting prompt using the trained language model.
- **Customizable**: Allows customization of hyperparameters such as batch size, block size, and model architecture parameters to fit different use cases and datasets.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchtext (for processing text data)
- tqdm (for progress bars during training)

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/transformer-language-model.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare Data**:
   - Ensure your text dataset is available and accessible.
   - Update the `input.txt` file with your text data.

4. **Train the Model**:
   - Adjust hyperparameters in the script (`model.py`) if needed.
   - Run the training script:
     ```
     python model.py
     ```

5. **Generate Text**:
   - After training, you can generate text using the trained model.
   - Run the generation script:
     ```
     python generate_text.py
     ```

## Example

Here's a simple example of how to use the model to generate text:

```python
python generate_text.py
```
