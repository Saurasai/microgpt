## Overview

The transformer-based language model implemented in this repository leverages PyTorch to create a neural network capable of generating text. It follows the Transformer architecture, which has demonstrated excellent performance in various natural language processing tasks.

## Usage

To use the language model, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/transformer-language-model.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare Data**:
   - Ensure your text dataset is available and accessible.
   - Update the `input.txt` file with your text data.

4. **Train the Model**:
   - Run the training script:
     ```
     python model.py
     ```

5. **Generate Text**:
   - After training, generate text using the trained model:
     ```
     python generate_text.py
     ```

## Model Architecture

The language model follows the Transformer architecture, consisting of self-attention mechanisms and feed-forward layers. It utilizes the following components:

- **Multi-Head Self-Attention**: Captures dependencies between tokens in the input sequence.
- **Feed-Forward Networks**: Performs nonlinear transformations on the output of the self-attention mechanism.
- **Positional Encoding**: Incorporates positional information into the input embeddings to maintain sequence order.

## Training

The model is trained using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with the AdamW optimizer. During training, the model learns to predict the next token in a sequence given the preceding tokens.

## Text Generation

Text generation is performed using the trained model. Given a starting prompt, the model generates new text by predicting subsequent tokens iteratively. Sampling from the predicted token probabilities enables the generation of diverse and contextually relevant text.

## Example

Here's a simple example of how to use the model to generate text:

```python
python generate_text.py
```
